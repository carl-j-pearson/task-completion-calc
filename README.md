#About

This shiny app was made to plot and calculate basic statistics around task completion, so the language refers to tasks throughout the interface. Statistically, this calculator will function around any set of bernoulli variables (success/failure, or anything other single observation of a binary outcome).

#Data entry side panel

First you can specify the amount of tasks you are testing (from 1 to 8), and then the total number of participants you tested across these tasks (from 1 to 50). From here, you can enter the total number of successes/completions you observed across the participants for each task.
